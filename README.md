# JavaScript HTML CSS | Focus Timer 2.0

A project that uses JS to make a Focus Timer to make better use of your time.

In this project I used clock that counts down time and buttons to control it.

In addition to that, there are buttons that play sounds when you click them.

In this project Clean Code was used, making it maintainable for updates and refactoring if needed.
